Subject: [smb4k-general] Problem Building smb4k-0.9.9
Message-ID: <4B5F38DE.4040604@merkens.ca>

I am having a issue in the build process.

Build environment:

    Centos 4.8 x86_64    (All patched up to current)

    The software I need to run only work's in the 4.x x86_64 Centos OS,
Proprietary Gyophisical application.

    So I cannot use anything newer, otherwise I put Mandriva 1010 which
has smb4k working just fine.

   

    Installed all the dev packages for KDE, Qt, etc.

    First approach to this was to get a rpm of smb4k allready done,
Centos did not have one so I dipped into Fedora's older OS's 4/5/6/7/8
in  attempt to make it easy, but I kept getting failed to find symbol
xxx when running, ie; missing some sort of library.

    decided to build it from scratch

    looked on the site and saw that 0.9.9 was intended for KDE 3.x and
since Centos 4.8 runs KDE 3.x and I cannot go newer this would be the
version to build.

After running the configure and fixing a few missing dev packages, ran
into first issue.

Fixed this from reading
http://www.kexi-project.org/wiki/wikiview/index.php at UsingSubversion.html

    *  RedHat / CentOS with KDE3.3; error like:

 ./kexi/kdeinit_kexi.la.cpp:3: error: visibility arg must be one of 
"default", "hidden", "protected" or "internal"

    Solution: Login as root and edit /usr/include/kde/kdemacros.h file.
Locate this line:

 #define KDE_EXPORT attribute ((visibility("visible")))

and replace it with:

 #define KDE_EXPORT attribute ((visibility("default")))

Then, continue compilation.

so far so good now I reach a new problem

All I could find was this one comment on
http://www.go4expert.com/forums/showthread.php?t=7971

Syntactically

    this pointer is not available in the static function because
compiler does not pass the this pointer into the static functions.

    As an example when you call the member function mf() from the object
obj of class C as follows

    obj.mf();

    Then compiler internally does the following

    mf(C this);

    But for static function this is not the case and so its not
available in the function.

Now semantically the concept is static functions can be called before
the creation of object and also independent of the object and so this
object is not created and so its not available.


So now I am stuck.....


Ideas?

I tried to build Smb4K 0.9 in a virtual machine with CentOS 4.8 installed and 
I had the same problems you also experienced. So, I fixed the compilation 
errors and now it builds just fine. Since a few other fixes accumulated over 
the past year, I will release a new KDE 3.x version of Smb4K shortly.

Cheers
Alexander
