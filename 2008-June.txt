Message-ID: <484D6D38.8080708@flami.net>

when i try to mount a ( password proteced ) share smb4k fails with the
error :
mount error 2 = No such file or directory
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g.man mount.cifs)

however when i run
smb4k_mount -s -t cifs -o user=user%password //host/share
                        e /smb4k

it works flawlessly, after running that command I can even mount from
within smb4k.

once I restart smb4k I cannot mount the shares anymore.

Is there a way to exactly see what command smb4k wants to execute ?

I guess that this is an authentication issue of some kind, but I'm not sure. 
In order to help you, I need to know a few things:

How is your network neighborhood organized? Is it an NT domain, an Active 
Directory environment or are there just a few workgroups (no domain and no 
Active Directory)? 

Which version of Smb4K are you using? Have you tried the latest version?

By the way, Smb4K does not report the command that it executes. You need to 
modify the source code in the Smb4KMounter::mount() function (in 
smb4k/core/smb4kmounter.cpp) to make it do this. Modify the end of the 
function so that it looks like this:

#endif
  // Report the command that will be executed:
  kdDebug() << command << endl;

  // Start the mount process:
  *m_proc << command;

  startProcess( Mount );
}

After that you need to recompile the source with debug symbols, that means you 
need to add the --enable-debug=full argument to the configure command. After 
you installed Smb4K, it should produce an output with the command when started 
from a terminal.

Best regards
Alexander

It is a little network with a few workgroups , and I try to mount shares
from a windows vista box.
Smb4k 0.9.4

I guess Ill try it with 0.9.5.

about the command , I wanted to find out what it does ( unfortunately
strace cuts out the important bits , even with -fv ) so i could try
running it by hand and see what happens.

After some tries I found out that the option : "port=139" is the cause
of the error, I tried exactly the same line smb4k will use without the
port option and the share is mounted without any problem.
Now I am wondering what might cause this , and how I could avoid this error.

the line that works is :
smb4k_mount -n -t cifs -o
netbiosname='JACKFLASH',uid=1000,gid=1000,rw,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,perm,nosetuids,noserverino,nomapchars,domain='WORKGROUP',ip=192.168.178.22,user=User
-- //'host'/'share' '/mount/point/'

it does not work for :
smb4k_mount -n -t cifs -o
netbiosname='JACKFLASH',uid=1000,gid=1000,port=139,rw,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,perm,nosetuids,noserverino,nomapchars,domain='WORKGROUP',ip=192.168.178.22,user=User
-- //'host'/'share' '/mount/point'

You can set the port globally in the configuration dialog (Samba->General 
Options), or you can define a custom port for a particular server with the 
Custom Options menu entry (Network Browser->popup menu->Custom Options, 
recommended). The port that you need to set should be 445.

Smb4K always sends the port, so its usage cannot be switched off.

I hope this helps.

Alexander
