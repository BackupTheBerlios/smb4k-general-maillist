<PRE>Hi,

I've just set up OpenSUSE 11.3 from scratch and found me fighting
against some mysterious problems with smb4k and/or samba.
smb4k 0.10.7
samba 3.5.4

AFAIK this machine is configured the same as another one that doesn't
exhibit this issue. Without much knowledge of samba in general, I'm kind
of stuck.

The problem appears like a wrong user/password pair when a share is
mounted from by double-clicking on the search result list. smb4k over
and over requests Username and Password and won't mount the share.
Since I've already enabled sudo for mount/unmount, I took the following
command from the system log and started it from the command line as root:

/usr/bin/smb4k_mount -s -t cifs -o
uid=1000,gid=100,port=445,rw,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,perm,setuids,noserverino,nomapchars,domain=TUX-NET,ip=192.168.1.91,user=&lt;share-username&gt;
-- //ZNASAP/share /home/sth/smb4k/ZNASAP/share

I'm prompted for the password and end up with
  mount error(13): Permission denied
  Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)

Account sth that owns /home/sth/smb4k/ZNASAP has uid 1000 and is member
of gid 100.

Couldn't get it to work until I did

  chmod 777 /home/sth/smb4k/ZNASAP/share

It existed from a previous trial with smb4k and wasn't removed
automatically since mount failed. Premissions were drwxrwx---.

Now the smb4k_mount as root or smb4k gui mounts the share without problems.
But why is rwx required for others? This is very likely the reason for
my problem since smb4k creates the mount points on the fly with the
user's default umask. I just don't understand why it doesn't work
without permissions for world (the configuration of the other machine
doesn't require this).


Best regards
Arnim
