get files, put files, etc.

smb4k worked for a while, but started to get confused when I was accessing
shares on my home network (which is WORKGROUP based, not DOMAIN based), and
then returning to work and trying to connect there.  I have a laptop.

I tried smbmount, which also fails. Right now smbclient seems to be the only
app that can connect.

Any help or troubleshooting tips you can send my way would be greatly
appreciated.

regards.
