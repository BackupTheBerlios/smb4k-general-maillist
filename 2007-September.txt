Subject: [smb4k-general] Extend smb4k to other protocols ?
Message-ID: <15116fd10709170231i3ca55c8et470b2b0c67ba70fb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I love smb4k as I'm now able to quickly mount my shares at work and
access them seemlessly through my filesystem without being root.

I'm working in a mixed windows / unix environment and I have to access
several smb shares as well as several ssh shares.

Do you think extending the possibilties of smb4k to other protocols as
well (ftp and ssh comes to my mind) would be interesting ? Now that
the kernel integrates "fuse", it's probably easier to handle and most
of the code probably already exists into smb4k.

What do you think about it ?

Konqueror already has support for ssh, with fish.

Typing "fish://myname at my.domain.com"  will ppen a fully graphical ssh
session within konqueror, no need for smb4k.

I know, but konqi supports ssh shares the same way it supports samba
shares : it won't "mount" an ssh share and add it to your filesystem.
That's what I'm looking for, so we need to use fuse-ssh / sshfs for
this, not konqi.
