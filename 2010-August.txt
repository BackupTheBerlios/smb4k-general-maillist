Hello Ezequiel,

you most like performed an update lately and pulled in the new cifs-utils package, that includes mount.cifs. Due to security concerns upstream, some newer versions of this package do not support user mounts, i.e. it is not possible to set the suid root bit for mount.cifs. 

What you can do to make Smb4K mount shares again is to use sudo. Go to Smb4K's configuration dialog, choose the "Super User" page and tick the "Use super user privileges to mount shares" option. If this does not work, please drop a note.

Best regards from Germany
Alexander
