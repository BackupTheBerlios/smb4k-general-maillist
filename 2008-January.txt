Subject: [smb4k-general] How does smb4k perform authentication and
 authorization when accessing a shared resource?
Message-ID: <477A2637.4040902@gmail.com>

Hi
Thank you for reading my post.
Can you please let me know whether smb4k support authentication when it 
want to access a shared folder?
for example, does it integrate with 
http://www.likewisesoftware.com/community/index.php/download/ for 
authentication?
What I can not understand is whether this package integrate our linux 
desktop with active directory or not?

Thanks
