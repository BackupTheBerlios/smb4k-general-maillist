Dear all,

I was running smb4k quite successfully until a few days ago on a SUSE 10.1 
with binaries from guru. Today I upgraded it to 0.8.1, and now I get the 
following error  (which I never saw before) when triyng to mount from the 
smb4k network browser:

WARNING: 'file_mode' not expressed in octal.
WARNING: 'dir_mode' not expressed in octal.
mount error 1 = Operation not permitted
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g.man mount.cifs)

Ioslaves from konqueror with smb:// still work ok.

Regs, Kostas

With the CIFS file system you need to provide the "File mask" and the "Directory mask"
options in octal, i.e. for example as 0755 and not as 755. Please check your settings in 
the configuration dialog (Samba -> mount) and correct them if necessary. You shouldn't 
get an error message afterwards.

Bye
Alexander

The error behaviour changed. Now I get the following error:

mount error 1 = Operation not permitted
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g.man mount.cifs)

The only thing I can think of that has changed is that I re-entered the 
permissions (thought it might be some gui character encoding problem) into 
the configuration as Alexander Reinholdt suggested and then restarted smb4k.

Configuration seemed ok. Both masks are 0755. and it still fails.

I only noticed after I sent the reply that the main problem is not  the warnings
due to the wrongly formatted file and directory masks but that you are not able 
to log in. Sorry.

 Does this happen with all servers or only with a few/a single one? I googled a 
bit and found a hint that authentication may fail if the _server_ has the setting
security = share instead of security = user.  Could you please check  this? What
happens, if you run mount.cifs manually (before changing any settings on the
server)?

Bye

I can't seem to be able to handle mount.cifs correctly. I get:

mercury:/home/kongeo # mount.cifs -t 
cifs //10.10.23.82/incoming ./smb4k/incoming -o 
username=guest,password=onoff,ip=10.10.23.82,rw

Mounting the DFS root for domain not implemented yetmount error: can not 
change directory into mount target cifs





Also, I get the same error for several servers (all winXP):

mount error 1 = Operation not permitted
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g.man mount.cifs)




Further, I can't seem to see where in XP (Pro, the machine I'm actiually 
interested in, but we also have others) I can set security to user instead of 
share. The security tab of the shares shows the permissions per user anyway 
(Maybe because it's XP Pro, XP Home it's I think not possible to set 
permissions per user)



However, I just found out, that when I set the file system to smbfs mounting 
is possible! Some default settings  of mount.cifs seem to be wrong.

...and after using smbfs I went straight to codepage hell...

I really would prefer the old "click and works" smb4k behaviour... :-(

mount.cifs does not know the parameter '-t cifs' and tries to interpret it as share
name. This obviously fails and you get the error message you are seeing. Use 
this command:

mount.cifs //10.10.23.82/incoming ./smb4k/incoming -o  username=guest,password=onoff,ip=10.10.23.82,rw

OK, so the problem is not the 'security = share' setting, because you have trouble connecting
to WinXP servers and not to Samba servers. 

In the meantime I found another potential cause of the  problem. Has the mount.cifs binary the
SUID root bit set? If not set it and retry or use super/sudo for mounting (configuration dialog -> 
Super User -> Programs). Is the mounting working now?
