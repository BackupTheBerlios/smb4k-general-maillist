Subject: [smb4k-general] Smb4k can only use CIFS

Hello Cristian,

Ubuntu (and Debian for that matter) has removed SMBFS support. Although there 
is a mount.smbfs present if you install Samba, it is a copy of mount.cifs. 
Thus all shares mounted with mount.smbfs have CIFS as their file system.

Smb4K checks on start-up for the existence of mount.smbfs and mount.cifs to 
determine if SMBFS and CIFS can be used. So, it is OK, that you can choose 
between both. However, that the SMBFS options are greyed out when you reopen 
the configuration dialog seems strange to me and I have to have a look at 
this.

I hope I could help.

Best regards
Alexander
