Message-ID: <4B001274.1030204@stella-maris.org.uk>

I can see my network OK and can see the Windows 2000 PC OK but it only 
seems to show two of its three ordinary shares. If I search for this PC 
the search panel results show all the shares hidden and the 3 I expect. 
I have tried removing the shares on the W2K PC and setting them up again 
but still it will show only 2 of the 3 shares, usually the last two 
alphabetically, so if I have Programs Weatherdata and Work only the last 
two show up. I am using 0.10.4 on Mandriva 2010.0. Any ideas?

Stuart

Hello Stuart,

this is a very strange problem. I haven't experienced it and cannot reproduce 
it here. Could you please provide the shell output produced by the following 
command:

$ net share list -l -p 139 -w <SERVER'S_DOMAIN> -S <SERVER> -I <SERVER'S_IP> -
U <USER>%<PASS>

If that command does not work, try replacing the port number 139 by 445. Is 
anything missing in the list of shared resources?

Have you set up the W2k PC as domain master browser or is there anything else 
that is special?

Cheers
Alexander

The output is

Share name   Type     Description
----------   ----     -----------
E$           Disk     Default share
IPC$         IPC      Remote IPC
D$           Disk     Default share
Work         Disk
F$           Disk     Default share
ADMIN$       Disk     Remote Admin
C$           Disk     Default share
WeatherData  Disk
Programs     Disk

It's Programs which is not showing up unless I search. I get the same 
output with port 445 as well.

There is no special setup for Master Browser if the Linux box is not up 
then it would be this remote PC as it is the only one on 24x7

OK, it seems that something is wrong with the code that exams the shell output and extracts the share names. I'll have a look at this next week.

Message-ID: <4B080697.9000900@stella-maris.org.uk>

I was re-booting a Windows 2000 PC which had a mounted share using SMB4K 
and I forgot to unmount it in Linux. After rebooting the PC and 
switching back to Linux I found SMB4K had crashed. Dont have the crash 
data as I dont have the debugger installed. I can attempt to recreate 
sometime if it would be useful. I am using 0.10.4 on Mandriva 2010.0.

Hello Stuart,

I would be grateful if you could provide the backtrace. It would help greatly 
on tracking down the bug.

Greetings
Alexander
