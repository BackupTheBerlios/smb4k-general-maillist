Subject: [smb4k-general] List abandoned due to move to Sourceforge.net
Message-ID: <1366903.CRuEsaF75K@dustpuppy>

Hello dear list members,

as of today, the mailing list smb4k-general at lists.berlios.de is abandoned due 
to our move to Sourceforge.net Please consider to use our 'General 
Discussions' forum at http://sourceforge.net/p/smb4k/discussion/general/ from 
now on.

Best regards
Alexander
