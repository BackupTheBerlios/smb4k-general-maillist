I have just installed the latest smb4k 0.10.6 having I think 
successfully compiled it, at least it runs and mounts shares OK. However 
I have a problem unmounting the shares and get

/usr/bin/smb4k_umount: invalid option -- 'n'

or this from force

smb4k_umount: invalid option -- 's'

as an error in a popup. What have I done wrong here? Is there something 
I have not installed?

You haven't done anything wrong. Actually, you found a bug. I fixed some issues 
in smb4k_umount in SVN HEAD and just copied it to the 0.10 branch. However, 
the version from SVN HEAD is incompatible with Smb4K 0.10.x and I did not 
remember that. :( 

I will release a new version shortly where this issue will be fixed.

I am relieved about that since I'm new to all this compiling stuff. I'll 
watch out for a new verion and have another go then.

using checkinstall as below

   file INSTALL cannot find 

 
"/home/stuart/smb4k-0.10.7/doc/en/smb4k/dialog_synchronization_input.png". 

Call Stack (most recent call first): 

   doc/en/cmake_install.cmake:37 (INCLUDE) 

   doc/cmake_install.cmake:37 (INCLUDE) 

   cmake_install.cmake:41 (INCLUDE) 



make: *** [install] Error 1

****  Installation failed. Aborting package creation.

Hm... I don't know. I haven't experienced this kind of failure. But I think, 
if Smb4K works fine, you can ignore it.

Just to confirm I had to do a sudo make install in order to get it 
working which means it is not in my repository. But it's no big deal.
