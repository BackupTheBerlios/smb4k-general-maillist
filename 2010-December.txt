I've narrowed this a bit down. Switched from umask 007 to 022, so the
directories for the mount points are created with permissions
drwxr-xr-x. This seems to be enough for smb4k_mount to succeed.
Interestingly, this umask setting results in the same directory mask
bits for the mount point that's set in the mounting options of Smb4k.
Although 0755 is requested as the directory mask in the mount options,
the mount point dir is not created using this mask. Instead, it's
influenced by the umask setting.

Cheers
Arnim
