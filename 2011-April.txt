Sorry that it took so long.

I tried to reproduce this problem with the development version of Smb4K that 
uses the KAuth framework instead of smb4k_mount/smb4k_umount. The good news is 
that it does not seem to be affected. So, maybe you want to consider to 
download the latest alpha release and give it a try.

I haven't had the time to pinpoint the problem with Smb4K 0.10.x. But since it 
will soon be superseded by Smb4K 1.0.0 I'm not sure if it is worth the 
effort...

Best regards
Alexander
