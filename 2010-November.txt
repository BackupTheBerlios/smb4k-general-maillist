Hello!

The problem arises because the new mount.cifs binary is not installed setuid root, i.e. only root is allowed to mount remote shares. However, you can go to Smb4K's configuration dialog and enable super user privileges using sudo for mounting and unmounting (Super User -> Use super user privileges for mounting and unmounting shares). After that, mounting should work again.

Best regards
Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-general] Can't mount share, permission denied
Message-ID: <4CE97D0B.2090700@gmx.net>

Hi,

I've just set up OpenSUSE 11.3 from scratch and found me fighting
against some mysterious problems with smb4k and/or samba.
smb4k 0.10.7
samba 3.5.4

AFAIK this machine is configured the same as another one that doesn't
exhibit this issue. Without much knowledge of samba in general, I'm kind
of stuck.

The problem appears like a wrong user/password pair when a share is
mounted from by double-clicking on the search result list. smb4k over
and over requests Username and Password and won't mount the share.
Since I've already enabled sudo for mount/unmount, I took the following
command from the system log and started it from the command line as root:

/usr/bin/smb4k_mount -s -t cifs -o
uid=1000,gid=100,port=445,rw,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,perm,setuids,noserverino,nomapchars,domain=TUX-NET,ip=192.168.1.91,user=<share-username>
-- //ZNASAP/share /home/sth/smb4k/ZNASAP/share

I'm prompted for the password and end up with
  mount error(13): Permission denied
  Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)

Account sth that owns /home/sth/smb4k/ZNASAP has uid 1000 and is member
of gid 100.

Couldn't get it to work until I did

  chmod 777 /home/sth/smb4k/ZNASAP/share

It existed from a previous trial with smb4k and wasn't removed
automatically since mount failed. Premissions were drwxrwx---.

Now the smb4k_mount as root or smb4k gui mounts the share without problems.
But why is rwx required for others? This is very likely the reason for
my problem since smb4k creates the mount points on the fly with the
user's default umask. I just don't understand why it doesn't work
without permissions for world (the configuration of the other machine
doesn't require this).


Best regards
Arnim

This an odd behavior. As far as I can remember, I never experienced something 
like this.

I checked the permissions on my system and all directories that are created by 
Smb4K have drwxr-xr-x. Did you manually change the permissions? Or did you run 
Smb4K as root?

Since you write that Smb4K mounts the share without problems, is your problem 
fixed or does it persist?

I guess that the permissions of newly created directories are derived
from the umask setting, which is 0007 for the sth account. I changed
permissions manually to drwxrwxrwx for analysis purpose once the
directory was created by Smb4K.
And no, I didn't run Smb4K as root.

Smb4K mounts the share if I set the directory permissions manually to
777. But as soon as the share is unmounted, Smb4K will remove the
directory and the next time the newly created directory has insufficient
permissions. So my problem persists: I can't mount shares without manual
interaction from the command line.

So to solve the root cause I need to understand why mounting only works
if the mount point has drwxrwxrwx permissions. I haven't found any clue
on the net yet. And except from the error message, there's no trace to
start debugging with.
