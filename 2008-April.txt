Subject: [smb4k-general] Windows network computor disk/folder mounting not
	working.
Message-ID: <200804141952.30553.vk4tux@bigpond.com>

I find that in smb4k ,now the GUI dropdown; ?mount? menu command has no effect 
on mounting the drive or directory. Hence I cannot access the files within. 
It was working for a while, while I was trying to setup a remote network  
printer.

I run cent-OS 5 OS on my main machine, with two other networked XP PC?, on a 
microsoft ?MSHOME" workgroup. I run the samba localhost?? sever from Linux 
(cent-OS 5). I cant understand why the GUI mount command has no effect? Any 
help please???

Sorry if its a bit simple, but it? beyond me at the moment.

Adrian

Hello Adrian,

I guess that you are not allowed to execute mount.cifs/smbmount as normal user 
on your system. So, mounting a share fails. Try ticking the "Use super user 
privileges to mount and unmount shares" in the "Super User" page of the 
configuration dialog. The program sudo or super has to be installed for this 
option to work and you need to know the root password.

If this does not help, please drop a note.

Bye
Alexander

Alexander,
                     I have sudo and the two options enabled in superuser tab. 
I have all super/sudo relevant programs installed via Yum Extender. I cannot 
preview (no files show) the network drive C or mount C (right click > left 
click  mount(Cntrl + M) in dropdown menu. There just is no response, just a 
quick ?mounting"message, in lower status bar, and a screen shake, but no 
access or mount indication. I'm using smb4k samba mount ??IFS? file system 
option.

regards

Adrian

In order to help you, I think I need some more information. First, which 
version of Smb4K and Samba are you using? What operating system is running on 
the server you want to connect to?
