Hi all

After trying for some time to compile smb4k on my fedora 3 machine i
gave it up and took the .rpm. It works now perfecly.

First I have to congratulate the developpers for this splendid
programme! It's exactly what I was looking for with not too many
features but exactly those which are needed, everything with the right
options, links and shortcuts! Great!!

The reason why I tried it to install from source is the following:
The bookmarks are one of the most genious Ideas! However - as I am a fan
of personalisation - I searched an option to give a description to the
bookmarks. Did I miss something or is there nothing (yet) available? I
would have sent a suggestion of code, but since I cannot compile from
source this makes no sense - sorry.

In the attachments you find some images explaining my idea...perhaps one
could bring something in of this in the next version?

Kind regards
